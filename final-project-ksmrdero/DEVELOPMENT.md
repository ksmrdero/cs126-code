# Developing Face Detection

## Progress
* Installed OpenCV and integrated it with Visual Studio 2017
* Tested library by executing a simple program which reads in an image and shows it in a window
* Got face detection to work using Haar Cascades from OpenCv
* Added filters to add to a detected face (i.e. glasses, hats)
* Added an options menu to allow users to choose their filter

## Challenges
* Video recorder lag when face detection is implemented 
* Face and eye detection are very sensitive. This causes filters to show instability around the face as well
* Filters get grainy over time
* Options menu is very sensitive to mouse movements
