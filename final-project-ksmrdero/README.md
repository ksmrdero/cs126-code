# CS 126 Final Project
## Face Detection in OpenFrameWorks

This face detection program is an OpenFrameWorks application that can detect a user's face given a camera, and add certain filters to the provided image (i.e. hats, glasses, etc.). 

## Requirements
This project requires OpenFrameWorks installed along with the libraries ofxOpenCv and ofGraphics. To install, go to <https://openframeworks.cc/>.

## Usage
To run this project, simply run the main file, and as long as a webcam is connected to the project, an image will display in a new window. To choose different filters, drag right or left and the program will automatically detect a chosen filter. To take a picture of the current screen, press the center option button or press the space bar. Pressing the 's' key shows the outlines from the face detection outputted by the program. Both key funtionalities work with the laptop's keyboard as well as the keyboard on the screen.
